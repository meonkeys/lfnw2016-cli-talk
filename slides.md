I'll recap everything for you later. We have a note-taker.

Be present, ask questions. I'll moderate.



Also, I won't read my slides.

SpeakerNote: Words from my talk title. I hope your mind is blown, but--just

helpful/fun/inspiring tidbit that improves your command-line experience, I'll
have achieved my goal.
